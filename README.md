# fb-msg-retriever
**Requires facepy to function. Install facepy first. Shoutout to @jgorset, the primary developer of facepy.** This is my first attempt at working with APIs/SDKs. It's a pretty basic application, which retrieves your facebook messages for you. Since it's a basic application, the user must enter the access token himself/herself. To retrieve the proper Access Token, which is compatible with this script, visit 'developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/' and login to your fb account, if asked to. Click on the 'Get Access Token' and select the 'Get User Access Token'. Select the v2.3 or older. Click on the radio button opposite to the 'read_mailbox' permission,  and hit 'Get Access Token', Click 'OK' when prompted by Facebook. The Access Token field will now contain a string. Run the script, and paste the Access Token when asked. Voila!
